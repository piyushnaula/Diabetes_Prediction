# Diabetes Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health parameters.

# Features

- Real-Time Prediction*: Instantly predicts diabetes based on user inputs.
- User-Friendly Interface*: Built using Flask for a simple and interactive web interface.
- Machine Learning Model*: Uses the Logistic Regression algorithm for prediction.
